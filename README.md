# Ethereum Logging Framework


This framework provides advanced logging capabilities for Ethereum applications on top of Web3J / Ethereum's JSON RPC. It consists of four components:

- Ethql: a query language for data on Ethereum
- Validator: a component to check ethql documents for specification erros
- Extractor: a component to extract, transform and format data based on ethql
- Generator: a component to create efficient logging functionality that can be embedded into smart contracts

Example ethql documents include
- [AugurContractRegistry.ethql](./src/main/resources/AugurContractRegistry.ethql)
- [CryptoKitties.ethql](./src/main/resources/CryptoKitties.ethql)
- [GeneratorShirtExample.ethql](./src/main/resources/GeneratorGitExample.ethql)
- [GeneratorGitExample.ethql](./src/main/resources/GeneratorShirtExample.ethql)
- [NetworkStatistics.ethql](./src/main/resources/NetworkStatistics.ethql)

Code demonstrating the use of the component scan be found here
- [Validator](src/main/java/au/csiro/data61/aap/samples/ValidatorTest.java)
- [Extractor](src/main/java/au/csiro/data61/aap/samples/ExtractorTest.java)
- [Generator](src/main/java/au/csiro/data61/aap/samples/GeneratorTest.java) (the generated code has been tested with Solidity 0.5.10)

## Build

1. Ensure Java 13 is installed locally and the env var `JAVA_HOME` is properly set.

To check whether Java has been set up correctly, run
```bash
mvn --version
```

2. To build the project, run
```bash
cd ethereum-logging-framework
mvn verify
```

Now you're ready to develop!

## Unit Test

To run unit tests, run
```bash
mvn test
```

## Integration Test

To run integration tests with a local ethereum network, run
```bash
mvn -Pintegration-tests verify
```
which will automatically start a local ethereum network before tests
and tear down the network afterwards.
